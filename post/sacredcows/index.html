		<p>First, it&rsquo;s useful to clear the road of the detris of past frameworks and take the attitude that nothing is sacred.
At the center of any theory should, above all, be established empirical findings. After that we have principles of
theory-building that include self-consistency and base principles that we can observe appearing over and over with some confidence.
The first means it&rsquo;s one coherent system where all the parts work together according to a consistent framework, not fragmented
systems for each type of function with no idea how they interrelate. (We can have multiple systems and multiple levels of description,
but we should have some framework for how those elements interrelate in a larger combined framework.)
By the second I&rsquo;m referring to some basic principles that have independently and repeatedly revealed themselves, or revealed
itself in a way that commands a lot of confidence. Morsella recommended four such principles, EASE (elemental, action-based, simple, and evolution-based).
I&rsquo;m going to offer a few more below, or take from other places like Glimcher&rsquo;s work, such as baselining &amp; Stevens Power Law, etc.
Another key area of principles is the level of description we&rsquo;re working at (the level of operation, cortical maps; a funcitonal perspective
based on the network of functions across maps, and not based on neurophysiology or structure with no inquiry into function, etc.)</p>

<p>Once we have something established, we should be sure that it has a solid place in the system, and isn&rsquo;t
arbitrarily dropped in other quarters just because it&rsquo;s not as visible.</p>

<p>So we want this framework to be self-consistent, based on empirical findings and its own principles, like the EASE and other principles like operational/functional.</p>

<p>For some old sacred cows, we want to completely debunk them as wholly inconsistent with our framework and not hesitate in
tossing them in the trash heap of outdated theory. However, even in doing this, it matters <em>why</em> the old theories are inconsistent,
and explaining the inconsistencies can go a long way to capturing what NEATL is in the positive sense.</p>

<p>Some parts of old theories we need to keep for our framework, not because of tradition, but because they&rsquo;re themselves founded on
well established empirical findings and have a natural place. But even here we want to demystify the authorative parts, so that we
can come in with the right attitude. Elements should stick around because they have a natural fit with a self-consistent framework,
not because of past authority. We should feel comfortable keeping what fits and tossing what doesn&rsquo;t. Even in demystifying, we shouldn&rsquo;t hestitate
to keep principles and findings which fit the model.</p>

<p><strong>+ Sherrington / Hebb</strong>
Classic behaviorism has to go. One of the foundtions of classic behaviorism is the Sherrington model of neural structure.
Sherrington introduced a conduction framework of afferent pathways of perception signals from senses up into the void, and efferent
pathways of action signals from the void down to muscles. In something like the neurophysiological equivalent of the Laffer Curve,
Sherrington&rsquo;s model suggested that at various points, the afferent pathways met the efferent pathways, and in between was a simple
conduction of glorified stimulus to glorified response. Hebb added the idea that neural pathways</p>

<p>This gave the image that the mind was a stim/response black box.</p>

<p><strong>+ Pavlov / Skinner / Watson </strong>
Pavlov, Skinner, and Watson constructed a conduction model of learning and behavior that was effectively operationalized Sherrington.</p>

<p><strong>+ Freud et al</strong></p>

<p>First, Freud is a top-down psychology of fiat, where high-level structures take the protagonist&rsquo;s role of construciting meaning and directing behavior,
E.g., a self-recognizing mechanism that takes actions to defend itself from emotional trauma or vulnerabilities.
Our model here is decidedly bottom-up. We describe in terms of neural structures that operate according to principles we construct out of observing their structure and behavior.
It&rsquo;s sub-symbolic, below the level of meaning and language; which is important, e.g., in that we don&rsquo;t have to assume some baseline of meaning and language already available, below
which we can&rsquo;t dig, which (1) puts an absolute limit on what mental behavior we can describe (only behavior mediated through meaning, but nothing else) and (2) is either groundless
(we can&rsquo;t talk about the mechanisms that construct meaning and language itself) or paradoxical &amp; self-exploding (to the extent one tries to explain the construction of meaning or language through
elements that already assume langauge and meaning).</p>

<p>We still want to keep a lot of classic psychology. Glimcher&rsquo;s model gives us a way to fit lower level structures (like decision-urging cortical maps) and higher-level structures
(like the construction of a narrative of self that acts, through executive action structures and the calculus of action scripts, on its own behalf, not only for self-preservation, but for recognition and self-actualizing.)
Basically, the higher-level structures give guidance of what the lower-level structures are acting towards, their function.</p>

<p>There are lots of good reasons why one would want to give priority to the bottom-up approach over the top-down one.
The major reason that first comes to my mind is that, in a bottom-up description, we&rsquo;re starting with structures that we
can immediately describe in terms of structure and function with concrete and discrete mechanisms.
They&rsquo;re structures designed out of evolution, constructed through genetics, and operate by the principles of neurophysiology, and you can connect all the dots quite
concretely.
For high-level structures, we have a lot of extra pieces we need to put in place before we can even start describing anything; we have to have years of child development
and language and cultural learning adding thousands of new elements on top of the vanilla system before our description has any traction over actual behavior.</p>

<p><strong>+ Frege / Carnap / Predicate Calculus</strong>
The formalization of semantics into glorified functions in the framework of set theory falls into the same top-down fiat trap that Freudian psychology does.
Our framework is subsymbolic.</p>

<p><strong>+ Sassure </strong>
One of Sassure&rsquo;s major principles is the framing of langauge in terms of a signifier/signified relationship. You can see right off it&rsquo;s
a conduction model, which we want to get away from.
It&rsquo;s at a symbolic level where it&rsquo;s operating as a conductive function between the word and concept or referant, when we want to describe at a
sub-symbolic level of the construction of meaning from non-meaningful elements.
What I don&rsquo;t trust about Sassure&rsquo;s approach is that it simply doesn&rsquo;t seem to describe the nuanced and much richer relationship between
word and concept one gets in cognitive psychology and cognitive linguistics. In cognitive linguistics, the meaning of a sentence involves
elements that are not within the formal structure of the sentence itself, which directly contradicts a few sacred cows, the signifier-signified
relationship, the hard separation of pragmatics from lexicogrammar analysis, and the compositional principle of meaning.</p>

<p><strong>+ Chomsky</strong>.
Chomsky argued that the language system is a self-contained module whose primary function is to
operate an innate (gentically input) grammar, which arbitrary langauges can flesh out. That put grammar at the center of language
cognition, and along the way segregated the logical structure of grammar construction from implementation and oust the action-oriented
side of language into other systems, or where it was necessary to contribute to meaning, he created a category he called &ldquo;pragmatics&rdquo; to keep it out of the language system proper.
Long story short, NEATL theory, like cognitive linguistics, has a framework of language construction and operation that&rsquo;s entirely integrated with action-production
system, and is not a separate system at all. There&rsquo;s no inherent grammar (the way Chomsky spoke of it; in our theory, there is a kind of functional structure of action which has grammar-like
features), no formal separation of linguistic action from other types of action, no separation of grammar and pragmatics. Most of all, cognitive linguistics
finds the search for structures of innate grammar as an awful way to investigate language, since it&rsquo;s very starting point is to ignore action systems
and how children bootstrap and learn grammar in child development (the starting points of cognitive linguistics).</p>

<p><strong>+ Piaget</strong>
<strong>+ Vygotsky </strong></p>

<p><strong>+ Keohane [&hellip;] / behavioral economics </strong>
The major issue with Keohane&rsquo;s cognitive bias theory, in the framework of neuroeconomics,
is that it treats cognitive mechanisms as if they were fragmented cheap hacks.
Neuroeconmics presents a self-consistent unified framework based on structure (action-based, evolution-based, principles),
that doesn&rsquo;t arbitrarily add or take away
So the already classic example is that the psychophysical mechanics of Steven&rsquo;s Power Law
provides the functional structure for the Baseline Cognitive Bias.</p>

<p>The [inverse power curve] built into the strucure of dopaminergic systems of valuation captures
the functional structure of the gambler&rsquo;s fallacy.</p>

<p>It is much better to understand these not as arbitrary fragmented biases, cheap hacks in the code, but as structural features
of a consistent system (built over billions of years of evolution, so the exact opposite of a cheap hack. Rather they&rsquo;re
foundational design pricniples behind the cognition of all life on planet earth since the Cambrian Explosion at the latest) that we
happen to notice give results
Granted, they are cheap in the operational terms of computational overhead to resolve everyday utiltiy-seeking issues, but not in terms of
structure or function. They&rsquo;re part of a well-designed coheret system that is acting exactly according to their core design principles.</p>

<p><strong>+ Fodor&rsquo;s Massive Modality  </strong></p>

<p>Current neurophysiology and cognitive science work describes the modalities of cognitive structure and function in a much more sophsticated
way than Fodor&rsquo;s relatively simple model. There are still mechanisms which address tasks relatively self-contained.
Morsella: the more automatic the response mechanism, the more self-contained its processing on inputs to last-path outputs.
But there is redundancy across maps; there are up-stream, down-stream, and lateral-stream pathways in densely networked maps and mechanisms,
with top-down and bottom-up processing.
This happens even with automatic functions, but it&rsquo;s particularly true for so-called &ldquo;volitional&rdquo; mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>+ Baars&rsquo; Global Workspace</strong>
Baars&rsquo; framework is still quite influential, but he used unfortuante, or at least potentially misleading terminology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Global&rdquo; has the connotation that [&hellip;]. Our theory here suggests that contents are relatively discrete events which do not themselves
have access to other events or even their own predecessors or successors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Workspace&rdquo; has the connotation that there are a few dominant mechanisms which integrate contents, as a platform on which recognition/attentional processing &amp; decision making
happens. It is better to read workspace more metaphorically. The mechanisms may be</p>
