		<p>First, some notes on cortical maps.
In cognitive development textbooks, the story is that these maps grow out of projections of the thalamus.</p>

<p>The thalamus is known as the Grand Central Station of perceptual information, directing signals from the senses to cortical maps which process them into
forms the decision-making maps (the ones we care about here) can operate on to plan and trigger action. The thalamus has a map of the information space
for each sense &ldquo;drawn&rdquo; on its surface. Presumably that comes from the thalamus originally being structured by projections directly from the incoming sense signals, what the maps needed
 to make the most sense of them for action, via natural selection. And what the maps most needed, and what the DNA/mechanics of fetal cortical development relationship
 is good at delivering on, was geometrical maps of the &ldquo;funcitonal space&rdquo; of the sense modality. For vision, the maps are hyperbolic representations of the visual field,
 with spaces in the field representing visual or meta-features at those areas in the visual field.
 (This story is still something of an oversimplification.
 Visual processing involves lots of offshoots across other areas of the brain that don&rsquo;t fall so neatly in this picture, e.g., entire subsystems making up &ldquo;where&rdquo; and &ldquo;what&rdquo; processing.
 But it may be notable to note these offshoot processing still basically work through the mainline affererent-to-efferent pathways.)
So there&rsquo;s a relationship between function and geometry, captured
 by the idea of activity in functional space. We can think about the modality of perception, action, and volition in those terms, where content is a crystallization of
 a site within an abstract functional space, or factored across the intersection of multiple functional spaces.</p>

<p>As a fetus develops in the womb, projections from the midbrain, and the thalamus surface in particular, are grown and dragged upwards towards the cortical surface.
As they is pulled the sensory maps make incessant copies of themselves, so by the time they arrive at the cortical surface we have chains of incoming (afferent)
cortical maps for each sense modality.</p>

<p>Then in the outbound (efferent) direction, we have maps of action modalities out to the skeleto-motor systems to direct motions of the body according
to their respective modality. Presumably these are like mirror image projections originating from what the destination skeleto-motor systems need to operate via natural selection.
In our vision-saccade case, the efferent maps again contain a geometry of the visual field, but activity on sites on the map now direct eye saccades
to those areas, and further action systems take that information to smoothly slide the eye to look towards that location  in the visual field.</p>

<p>The mechanisms operate through cortical maps by functional modality, shifting eye focus by saccades, reaching one’s hand out and in of local proprioceptive space, traversing over terrain by walking or crawling, orienting one’s head or body viz. local space, etc. With mechanical modality being the organizing principle, the model is associated with topographical maps representing that modality as the basic structural feature. For eye saccades, it’s a topographical map of the visual space; for hand movements it would be a topographical map of local proprioceptive space; for traversing terrain it would be a topographical map of intermediate traversable space.
On these maps is overlaid activity which, out of the map’s very structure, represents a proposed motion and, when triggered, an action motion. For an eye saccade, activity on the topographical map of visual space represents a proposed motion of the eye focal point to the point in the visual field represented by the center of the activity, and when triggered, an actual motion of the eye focal point to that visual field point in the form of a saccade, a rapid motion of coordinated muscles rotating the eyeball from its present location to the triggered location.
Other action modalities, such as reaching one’s hand out, work in analogous ways, although it is important to note that eye saccadic motion is easier to describe because it involves fewer elements. Other action modalities such as reaching out to grab something and pull it back to one’s self, walking along rocky terrain, or uttering out a cry to grab the attention of others around oneself, involve the coordination of multiple action areas, so cannot be so neatly packaged. The basic principle is the same for these modalities, but it requires more explanation.
This is one reason why Glimcher focuses on eye saccades. The important point here, and one of the points Glimcher tries to emphasize, is that the critical elements of decision-making are all contained in the eye saccade example. While other systems involve more moving parts, they should follow the same basic principles, only tuned to the mechanics of their own mechanical modality of action.</p>

<p>As mentioned, there are countless map copies in chains, each one slightly altered to perform different functions.
The maps we care about are in between afferent and efferent pathways, so as to serve as the final gateways to action, [the last path].</p>
