<p><strong>Intentionality</strong></p>

<p>Intentionality is the property in language (or other meaningful actions) by which words and phrases are about
 to things (situations, events) in the world. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;aboutness&rdquo; of a phrase or action.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s what makes the word &ldquo;rock&rdquo; in a normal English sentence about a rock and not, say, an orange.</p>

<p>There are a number of approaches philosophers have used to understand what exactly intentionality is and how it works.</p>

<p>In classic Continental Philosophy, Brentano was famous for saying intentionality was the core feature of human psychic life,
of consciousness, which Husserl used as the foundation of phenomenology.
Intentionality becomes the mechanism where objects in the world serve function for the agent.
As Heidegger develops the concept, wind is for pushing sails, etc.
So when one is sailing, being engaged in the action brings one in direct contact with the wind as that which is pushing the sails.</p>

<p>In Analytical Philosophy, the conncetion between language and thing was boiled down to the logical structure of language use.
The word &ldquo;rock&rdquo; was about rocks because when it was applied to a rock in the world, what it described was true, and
if it applied to an orange it wasn&rsquo;t true. By &ldquo;true&rdquo;, this just meant there were grounds to validate
 the sentence viz. the rock to some sufficient level of satisfaction.
 Within the limits of meaningfully recognizing the situation, it appears to be about a rock in the world sufficiently
 well to have enough confidence in it to rely for some end (which confidence may be more or less depending on the situation).
Analytic Intentionality via Carnap, Quine, Davidson, Searle, [Putnam], [Naming &amp; Necessity guy]&hellip;</p>

<p>So these are some classic strands for discussing intentionality.</p>

<p>How would the way I&rsquo;ve developed NEATL Theory address the issue?</p>

<p>The way I&rsquo;ve framed it, it&rsquo;s closer to the Continental Theory way of framing intentionality.</p>

<p>The connecting tissue to human action in NEATL theory is motivation viz. some world situation
 (which includes both internal and external elements, a very general sense of &ldquo;world&rdquo;).</p>

<p>When we think the meaning of a sentence, we look to the conditions of its construction.</p>

<p>It was constructed by action mechanisms operating to (attempt to) satisfy a calling goal or set of goals.</p>

<p>The role that the lexicogrammatical element &ldquo;rock&rdquo; in a sentence plays in the chain of goal/satisfaction links
to the ultimate goal of making the point the agent is making <em>as it relates to some rock object, or
the general idea of a rock, in the world writ large</em> is the grounds through which we can understand a sense in which the sentence is about the rock.</p>

<p>NEATL Theory frames langauge in such a different way than some classic concepts in philosophy of language that
we should step back and consider that framing.</p>

<p>In NEATL Theory, like cognitive linguistics generally, elements in the language are not well represented as single unit &ldquo;words&rdquo;.
A word or phrase is better represented as a chunked move with the strategy in a dialog ritual (or other language-use ritual)
of playing a coordinated part to advance whatever goal(s) the agent has in the ritual through the language-use.</p>

<p>It does not play well with the Sassure framing of words arbitrarily referring to things, signifier and signified.
So the framing of the problem as &ldquo;how is the word &lsquo;rock&rsquo; about a rock?&rdquo; is already a misleading framing.</p>
