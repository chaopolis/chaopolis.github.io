		<p>The history of cognitive science, and the &ldquo;human sciences&rdquo; generally, vacillates between overconfidence
bordering on delusion to crises of confidence that chill work in the field, at least
to the extent they claim any explanation in the mechanics of the mind and not statistical generalities in narrow domains.
Looking at the tenor of the literature and reading a number of cartographers of the fields,
we are presently in the downswing of third generation cognitive science that started with the computer
revolution and a burst of optimism in the 1990s. While this generation could be called a triumph for
narrow theories and narrow AI, as investigation tools and brute force methods of computation became quite powerful,
it brought us ever closer to the limits of our methods and data without much generality or robustness to show for it.</p>

<p>Periodic boosts like the findings in behavioral economics and AI that beat humans at chess and go
are matched with deepening dispair about the limits to our models of mind, and
the collapse of influential models from Baars to Fodor.
The most robust theories are limited to relatively narrow domains
and at the lowest levels of description, at the level of neurophysiology and cognitive psychology,
perceptual baselining and priming. Higher level theories aren&rsquo;t very robust, and lower level theories
don&rsquo;t seem to scale up to higher levels well.</p>

<p>So the purpose of this book is to offer thoughts on a high-level theory of human volitional behavior
built out of  lower levels. What do I have to say to the skeptics? The primary thing I have to say is
not much. They are probably warranted to dispair and attack those that show any hints at optimism.
My intention isn&rsquo;t to be blind to their legitimate concerns
 with speculative theories. My purpose is to make a theory out of the general principles that I&rsquo;ve collected
 from a particular line in the literature (neural functionalism, the line of David Marr &amp; Paul Glimcher, in contrast to neural structuralism),
 and the higher level theories that are inspired by them (behavioral economics and cognitive linguistics when they care about cognition),
 and the directions that these lines are pointing, as an end in itself. These lines give us some general principles.
 I want to see how far they can pull diverse lines of explanation together, and what responses they&rsquo;d make to
 to the classic questions or challenges about cognition, like, in language, explaining intentionality or bootstrapping grammar.</p>

<p>To the extent there are robust empirical findings in cognitive science, I want to give them a central role.
 But as things quickly get empirically speculative at higher levels of description,
I am in the same boat everybody else is and do not claim any special privileged insight.
I think if one lays all the pieces we know out and takes the general principles we&rsquo;re getting from the neurofunctional line
 of the literature, along with thinking around the blind spotsin other fields, that insights emerge.
So I think of myself as playing with this kind of intellectual jigsaw puzzle.
I don&rsquo;t doubt it will get attacked at its weakest links. But I think there is enough in the principles and concept of the project,
and it&rsquo;s a project that&rsquo;s still neglected in some quarters, that it&rsquo;s worth pursuing to see how far the pieces connect.</p>

<p>Just regarding the interplay of optimism &amp; skepticism, ambition &amp; caution, I can only give my own personal take.
My academic heroes, within whose tradition I see myself, are those who are trying to construct general principles and models
in spite of the challenges and crossover into fields out of their ken.
People like Ray Jackendoff and Radu Bogdan come first to mind.
Whenever I read them, I invariably come across them delving into matters about which they clearly don&rsquo;t have
the same experience as in their home fields, but the nature of the issue requires them to speak into them anyway.
My attitude has always been constructive. Every field has its blindspots within the others, and our job is to take pieces
from each field and take the insights from people within it seriously, always with some humility for our own blindspots
and compassion for the blindspots of others. Anyway, that to me seems the most constructive attitude.
Also, I picked up an old habit studying philosophy. In philosophy, the task is to build the best arguments
for different lines, and then be able to switch frames and argue from multiple perspectives, like moving
 fluently through the entire argument space within which all these different theories lay.
 So even if one isn&rsquo;t a utilitarian, one knows how to construct and evaulate the best arguments for it, where its weakest parts are,
 and how we can respond to its weakest points to construct ever better versions of it.
What I&rsquo;m trying to do here is put together the best model for a ways of connecting low-level the neurophysiology of action (i.e., neuroeconomics)
 with high-level language and the narratives that emerge from language, personality, society, and culture, from what I&rsquo;m interpreting as the
 general principles of neurofunctionalism that are emerging.
It&rsquo;s something that will have to be done eventually one way or another to have a complete theory of human cognition,
and most, perhaps all, classic approaches have neglected the task. Many of them think the task is invalid to begin with.
I think there&rsquo;s enough we know now to talk about the steps we have to go through for such an enterprise, and that
walking that path and surveying the terrain, what would need to be done at each stage, is a useful exercise.
So that&rsquo;s what this series is trying to do. It really doesn&rsquo;t have a greater ambition.
I think the attempt can offer insights, but I don&rsquo;t know for sure it will.
But aside form that question, I think there&rsquo;s a right way to make the attempt
in any event, and I want to respect the general principles it calls for and do it the right way, with them in mind.
That&rsquo;s the motivation driving me here. It is up to factors beyond me whether it will be a successful theory or not.
 I just want to make it one that takes its own principles seriously &amp; constructs itself with them in mind, and
 tries to combine different levels so they mutually restrict each other and one can have an idea of how higher levels
 emerge from lower level mechanics.</p>

<p>All of that said, my idea for this work is something like a wiki page which can be updated over time as the ideas are developed and subjected to constructive scrutiny.</p>
