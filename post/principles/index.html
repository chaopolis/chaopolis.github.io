title: &ldquo;Proposed Principles of Human Being&rdquo;
date: 2017-08-25T15:25:01+09:00</p>

<h2 id="draft-true">draft: true</h2>

<p>I reserving this space to list some general principles and important points of my theory of human being, at various degrees of priority and inflexibility,
which I hope to amend over time as needed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At the root of the free will problem is the personal identity problem. Mechanisms integrating situations, norms, motivations, and volition
are mediating the will. The major issue from this is the extent to which it&rsquo;s fair to attribute these mechanisms to the self-expression
of an &ldquo;autobiographical self&rdquo;. This involves the integration of mechanisms of agency with the scripts running SDT in a coherent manner, among other things.</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;Free will&rdquo; is a function of explicit assertion of the narrative of self through self-determining action.</p></li>

<li><p>The explanatory order of systems that I currently think structures high level action is a neuroeconomic base of cortical action maps,
neo-Action Theory (executive heterarchical parallel action threads), signalling theory, social action, language bootstrapping, and
from there the script calculus of narrativology (from lower level concepts to high level SDT, institutions, and ways of life).
Each level builds on and works through the levels below it, with the neuroeconmic base always being the platform of action,
bootstrapped action scripts mediating meaning and narratives through them, and the penthouse being the brand of cognitive linguistics
shape by their mechanics.</p></li>

<li><p>The core of the approach is the mechanics of Action Theory and supporting systems (construction of situations and the self acting within them).</p></li>

<li><p>Contra-Chomsky, the core is not a logical innate structure of grammar. Our approach ends with a species of cognitive linguistics, where
linguistic action is a (specialized) form of volitional action generally.</p></li>

<li><p>Contra-Sherrington &amp; the behaviorists, the model of mind is not a conduction model linking afferent and efferent pathways.
The major players are the &ldquo;middle systems&rdquo; between them, systems which model and effectuate the functional structure of action in a situation,
such as volitional cortical maps, executive action planning, pre-frontal lobe action templates, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Contra-Frege, et al, the base of meaning is not at the abstract symbolic level. We need a system which constructs the features of predication
at the intentional level. Bogdan gives us the roadmap, which we have to re-construct via plausible (bootstrapped) cognitive operations.</p></li>

<li><p>Contra-Sassure, we don&rsquo;t want to represent language in terms of [&hellip;] and [&hellip;].</p></li>

<li><p>Contra-Fodor, vanilla massive modularity isn&rsquo;t the major paradigm of cognitive organization, functionally or operationally.
The major paradigm is closer to a heterarchical semi-modular network model. (Cf. Morsella)</p></li>

<li><p>A sentence is a set of instructions to trained executive volition systems to construct a &ldquo;meaningful situation&rdquo;.
That&rsquo;s why the entire meaning cannot be contained &ldquo;inside&rdquo; the sentence proper (contra-compositionality thesis).
The formal content &amp; structure of the sentence are only the skeleton of indstructions; a signal-recognition system then fleshes it out with meaning
(through the volitional action systems).</p></li>

<li><p>Knowledge is encoded as tropes or more or less crystallized (pre-keyed) action strategies to negotiate knowledge-needing situations.
Understanding is a function of the sensity of inter-connections of these strategy maps, and the arrangement of &ldquo;keys&rdquo; guiding
the agent through the functional trope space to talk through an issue in a functionally &ldquo;successful&rdquo; way.</p></li>

<li><p>Key-map mechanisms proliferate via the mechanics of recognition, attention, priming, and action.</p></li>

<li><p>Consciousness is a low level and fragmented mechanism linking feature content (by sense modality) to executive action planning. (Morsella)</p></li>

<li><p>A fundamental feature of conscious content is relentless baselining. Light is bright according to its recent relative displacement, which is quickly
renormalized to a new baseline. Stevens Power Law, Khaneman). Sugar is sweeter when you&rsquo;re hungry. Losses hurt more than the same gains please, against
an &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; or &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; baseline. Etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Our system is broadly a subsymbolic, neuroeconomic satisfaction system. Volitional systems prime heterarchical/parallel action threads, the triggers of which
(along with the change in world or situation state) cash in the priming as a subjective value payoff, which feedsback into future primings, and can get
crystallized into increasingly offline action tropes with repeated use.</p></li>

<li><p>Action priming is thickly parallel and heteararchical, in multiple respects. On the operational level: it&rsquo;s a negotiation of action priming and selection between ground level
bottom-up action systems (individual kinesthetic muscle groups) and top-down executive or higher level action systems (primed for coordinated sequences of actions, where
the earlier actions are already pre-programmed in integration with later actions, and other complexities, e.g., forking, parallelism, fragments, orphans, etc). Functionally, it&rsquo;s a negotation between
low level action plans (twisting one&rsquo;s wrist and flexing fingers to grasp an object), midlevel plans (pull the apple out of the bag to eat) and higher level plans
(eat lunch for today; have a productive routine at work so as to advance in my career). This includes a great amount of nuance and complexity we get from
sophsticated Action Theory, parallel and branching intentions, goal orphans, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Words don&rsquo;t exist (as such). The mind doesn&rsquo;t encode a lexicon of words linking to meanings as such, like an internal dictionary.
In this theory, what we have are more like legal moves in a game that functionally advance the game-state in some way.
Words are more like strategies of action (to represent an object to a person) than symbols representing objects per se.
It&rsquo;s a subtle but important difference, particularly at the operational level.
This principle falls very naturally out of NEATL, where the langauge bootstrap is modeled specifically on crystallizing the rules and action strategies of a social game/ritual.</p></li>

<li><p>Notes on &ldquo;Words don&rsquo;t exist (as such)&rdquo;: Pulvermuller had the sensational discovery in the neurophysiology of language use (based I think on fMRI studies)
that word use does not have any special activity different from explicit memory knowledge generally.
To take this kind of finding seriously I think would entail a pretty revolutionary overhaul of what we think words, langauge, and knowledge actually are.
It reminds me of the quote in the Einstein biopic, when Einstein realizes with Lorenz&rsquo;s, et al, sensational finding that light doesn&rsquo;t change speed
in different moving reference frames that Lorenz doesn&rsquo;t get the bullet to the head to save Newton, Newton get&rsquo;s the bullet in the head to account for Lorenz.
Similar thing here; we have to re-do linguistics and epistemology to remodel words as action strategies to keep Pulvermuller&rsquo;s finding (and not explain the finding away to keep words).
John Hyman&rsquo;s book on action theory has a chapter to the effect that knowledge isn&rsquo;t a cognitive state but a capacity for action.
I think this theory might be in line with the NEATL model, but it requires more reflection to be sure.</p></li>
