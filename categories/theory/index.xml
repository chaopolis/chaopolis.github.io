      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. Motivations for and Goals of NEATL Theory, and an Important Caveat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Neuroeconomic Approach to Language, what I&amp;rsquo;ll call NEATL Theory, is a theory or set of ideas about the neurophysiology of structured
(or &amp;ldquo;meaningful&amp;rdquo;) volitional action, focusing particularly on the mechanics of motivation and value, to describe and explain language use.
It combines a number of ideas. Most simply, it is an attempt to model and explain
the mechanics of language through the structures, concepts, and approaches of neuroeconomics, a field developed by Paul Glimcher and others.
Neuroeconomics is &amp;ndash; to start with a grossly oversimplifying gist &amp;ndash; a framework using the structure and mechanics of
&amp;ldquo;decision-making&amp;rdquo; cortical maps, as they represent the utility of plans and trigger them into action, and their support mechanisms
(most importantly meta-action maps) to manifest (and thereby explain) voluntary action
of humans and animals and the (internal) structures and conditions under which it operates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
